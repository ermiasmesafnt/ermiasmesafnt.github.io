Game on a soccer field. You need tacos and a soccer ball. I train on grass with my coach. Messi is the best footballer in the world. They make hundreds of millions of dollars. my favorite team is Liverpool. My favourite player is Messi. The biggest prize is the World Cup. Messi is a Spanish-speaking player.

<p class="margin-borders"> I had always loved to play soccer since I was a little kid. I wasn’t very good when I was smaller and my dad introduced me to the sport because he loved it and he thought it would be good exercise for me, but i bet he didn’t think that I would end up loving the sport more than him. My dad put me on a recreational soccer team and I played every single saturday and I improved little every week. When I turned 11 my dad finally chose to put me on a competition team and i was very nervous for tryouts, but i ended up doing really well. I got put on a pretty good team and I became really good friends with everyone on the team, even the coach. My first season with the team I was on the bench most of the time, but on my second season I became starter and I was even captain once in a while.
