<p class="margin-borders"> I had always loved to play soccer since I was a little kid. I wasn’t very good when I was smaller and my dad introduced me to the sport because he loved it and he thought it would be good exercise for me, but i bet he didn’t think that I would end up loving the sport more than him. My dad put me on a recreational soccer team and I played every single saturday and I improved little every week. When I turned 11 my dad finally chose to put me on a competition team and i was very nervous for tryouts, but i ended up doing really well. I got put on a pretty good team and I became really good friends with everyone on the team, even the coach. My first season with the team I was on the bench most of the time, but on my second season I became starter and I was even captain once in a while.
